# Modular-NeuroEvolution
We develop academic tools to generate neural network's topology and/or weights using evolutionary algorithms.

This project relays on Grammatical Evolution in Java (GEVA) library and here we have included the source files of GEVA as we have modified some of the classes in our extension.
